### Procedure

The website will generate a field with a couple of squared cards. When a card is clicked it switch the color. There are always two cards with the same color.
With each attempt, the cards have new, randomly generated colors. Your goal is to find the second card with the same color and to solve whole field. If the second card isn't the right card the cards will switch back their color.

### Goal

The main goal is to solve the whole memory as fast as possible and with as few clicks as possible. Good luck! üçÄ
